# Randomized_controlled_trial

## Summary

The goal of this project was to understand the effect of using climate resilient seeds on farmer earnings in a randomized controlled trial setting. The data used is synthetic, and was generated for a class assignment for Accelerated Statistics II by Professor Manoli at Georgetown Univeristy.

The result of the analysis showed a relatively small, but positive impact on earnings when using the seeds: about $0.25 thousand increase on earnings. There was also significant spillover even for the pure control group, and this spillover increased with treatment intensity. About 20-80% of farmers assigned to control received treatment as treatment intensity increased from 0 to 75%, and there was no noncompliance in treatment. Thus, my finding is that the new climate resistant seed is a viable alternative to the current variant, as it increased earnings, and likeliness of usage was relatively high even in control groups.
